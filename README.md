## Introduction

This project focuses on utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques along with machine learning clustering algorithms to analyze a collection of articles . The main objectives are to preprocess the text data, extract meaningful features, cluster similar articles together, and visualize the clusters for insights.

## Project Workflow:
1. Data Collection:We start by collecting articles, used xml.etree. ElementTree module to read xml file and glob to real all the xml file at a time into the program

2. Text Preprocessing: The collected articles are often unstructured and contain noise. using the Beautiful Soup package sliced each XML document to convert into  text documents.We preprocess the text data by removing HTML tags, punctuation, special characters, and stopwords. Additionally, we perform lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms for better analysis.

3. Feature Extraction:  After preprocessing, we extract features from the text data, for machine learning tasks by converting it into a numerical format (i.e., a feature matrix) ,using the bag-of-words representation. The CountVectorizer from the sklearn.feature_extraction.text module in  scikit-learn library is used to tokenize the text, remove stopwords, and create a vocabulary of unique words.Additionally, we performed normalization to ensure that the features are on the same scale to get the better accuracy. 
 In this project, we use TF-IDF Transformer  (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to represent the importance of each word in the corpus.

4. Clustering: With the feature vectors obtained from TF-IDF, we apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to  the group  of similar articles together based on their content. We computed distortion and inertia (wcss) for different numbers of clusters,we found optimal number of  cluster by using Elbow Method i.e 6 .

5. Cluster Analysis: Once the clustering is done, we analyze the clusters to understand the topics covered in the articles. We visualize the clusters using word clouds to identify the most frequent terms within each cluster.


## Challenges:
•	We faced one challenge that  was determining the optimal number of clusters. We addressed this by using the elbow method, which analyzes the distortion or inertia within clusters for different numbers of clusters.
•	Another challenge was effectively preprocessing the text data to retain relevant information while removing noise. Techniques like stopword removal, lemmatization, and punctuation removal were essential for this task.

## Outcome:
The outcome of this project is a structured analysis of the articles, grouped into clusters based on their content. This allows for easier navigation and understanding of the diverse topics . Additionally, the visualization of clusters provides a quick overview of the main themes present in the articles.
